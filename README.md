## Installation
  To download my app, all you have to do is grab the necessary files from my repository and run 'npm install'. Then you have all you need to start making friends and adding interacting with them!
  
## Usage
  To use this app, all you need to do is go into the file with Git Bash and run 'npm start' to start the server, then you can perform CRUD operations on the local database. Otherwise you could connect this backend to a frontend of your own making and give this app a makeover!
